A: An acid is a substance that donates hydrogen ions (H+) to a solution.

Q: What is a base?
A: A base is a substance that accepts hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.

Q: What is a neutral solution?
A: A neutral solution is a solution with a pH of 7, indicating that it is neither acidic nor basic.

Q: What is an indicator?
A: An indicator is a substance that changes color in response to a change in pH.

Q: What is a salt?
A: A salt is a compound formed by the reaction of an acid with a base, where the hydrogen ion of the acid is replaced by a metal ion or another positive ion.

Q: What is a chemical bond?
A: A chemical bond is a force of attraction between two atoms that holds them together in a molecule.

Q: What is an ionic bond?
A: An ionic bond is a type of chemical bond that involves the transfer of electrons from one atom to another.

Q: What is a covalent bond?
A: A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond that involves the sharing of electrons between two atoms.

Q: What is a polar covalent bond?
A: A polar covalent bond is a type of covalent bond where the electrons are shared unequally between the two atoms.

Q: What is a nonpolar covalent bond?
A: A nonpolar covalent bond is a type of covalent bond where the electrons are shared equally between the two atoms.

Q: What is electronegativity?
A: Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a chemical bond.

Q: What is a chemical formula?
A: A chemical formula is a symbolic representation of a chemical compound using the chemical symbols of the elements present in the compound.

Q: What is a mole?
A: A mole is a unit of measurement used in chemistry to express amounts of a chemical substance.

A: Avogadro's number is the number of atoms, molecules, or ions in one mole of a substance, which is approximately 6.02 x 10^23.

Q: What is stoichiometry?
A: Stoichiometry is the calculation of the quantities of reactants and products in a chemical reaction.

Q: What is a limiting reactant?
A: A limiting reactant is the reactant that is completely consumed in a chemical reaction, limiting the amount of product that can be formed.

Q: What is a theoretical yield?
A: A theoretical yield is the maximum amount of product that can be obtained from a chemical reaction, based on the amount of limiting reactant present.

Q: What is an actual yield?
A: An actual yield is the amount of product that is actually obtained from a chemical reaction.

Q: What is a percent yield?
A: A percent yield is the ratio of the actual yield to the theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage.

Q: What is a solution?
A: A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, where one substance is dissolved in another.

Q: What is a solvent?
A: A solvent is the substance in a solution that dissolves the other substance.

Q: What is a solute?
A: A solute is the substance in a solution that is dissolved by the solvent.

Q: What is concentration?
A: Concentration is the amount of solute present in a given amount of solution.

Q: What is molarity?
