A: A generative adversarial network is a type of artificial neural network that consists of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, that are trained together to generate new data that is similar to the training data.

Q: What is transfer learning?
A: Transfer learning is a technique in machine learning where a model trained on one task is reused as a starting point for a new task.

Q: What is overfitting?
A: Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new data.

Q: What is underfitting?
A: Underfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model is too simple and does not capture the complexity of the data, resulting in poor performance on both the training and new data.

Q: What is regularization?
A: Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that encourages simpler models.

Q: What is a hyperparameter?
A: A hyperparameter is a parameter that is set before training a model and cannot be learned from the data, such as the learning rate or the number of hidden layers.

Q: What is a learning rate?
A: The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines how much the weights and biases are adjusted during training.

Q: What is a loss function?
A: A loss function is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.

Q: What is a cost function?
A: A cost function is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output, plus any regularization terms.

Q: What is a gradient?
A: A gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest increase in a function.

Q: What is gradient descent?
A: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient.

Q: What is stochastic gradient descent?
A: Stochastic gradient descent is a variant of gradient descent that randomly selects a subset of the training data for each iteration, making it faster and more scalable.

Q: What is batch normalization?
A: Batch normalization is a technique used in deep learning to improve the stability and performance of artificial neural networks by normalizing the inputs to each layer.

Q: What is dropout?
A: Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out some of the neurons during training.

A: Precision is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model that measures the proportion of true positives among all the positive predictions.

Q: What is recall?
A: Recall is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model that measures the proportion of true positives among all the actual positives.

Q: What is F1 score?
A: F1 score is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model that combines precision and recall into a single score.

Q: What is a ROC curve?
A: A ROC curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classification model that plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different threshold values.

Q: What is an AUC score?
A: An AUC score is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model that measures the area under the ROC curve.
