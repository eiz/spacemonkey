Q: What is a mold?
A: A mold is a tool that is used to shape and form materials such as plastic and metal.

Q: What is injection molding?
A: Injection molding is a manufacturing process that involves injecting molten material into a mold to create a product.

Q: What is extrusion?
A: Extrusion is a manufacturing process that involves forcing material through a die to create a specific shape.

Q: What is stamping?
A: Stamping is a manufacturing process that involves cutting and shaping metal using a press and a die.

Q: What is forging?
A: Forging is a manufacturing process that involves shaping metal by heating it and then hammering it into shape.

Q: What is casting?
A: Casting is a manufacturing process that involves pouring molten material into a mold to create a product.

Q: What is welding?
A: Welding is a manufacturing process that involves joining two pieces of metal together using heat and pressure.

Q: What is brazing?
A: Brazing is a manufacturing process that involves joining two pieces of metal together using a filler metal that melts at a lower temperature than the base metal.

Q: What is soldering?
A: Soldering is a manufacturing process that involves joining two pieces of metal together using a filler metal that melts at a lower temperature than the base metal.

Q: What is heat treating?
A: Heat treating is a manufacturing process that involves heating and cooling metal to change its properties.

Q: What is surface finishing?
A: Surface finishing is a manufacturing process that involves treating the surface of a product to improve its appearance or performance.

Q: What is quality control?
A: Quality control is the process of ensuring that a product meets the required standards of quality.

Q: What is ISO 9001?
A: ISO 9001 is a quality management system that is used to ensure that a company's products and services meet the required standards of quality.

Q: What is a defect?
A: A defect is a flaw or imperfection in a product that makes it unusable or unsafe.

Q: What is a non-conformance?
A: A non-conformance is a deviation from the required standards of quality.

Q: What is a corrective action?
A: A corrective action is a process that is used to address a non-conformance and prevent it from happening again.

Q: What is a preventive action?
A: A preventive action is a process that is used to identify and address potential non-conformances before they occur.

Q: What is a root cause analysis?
A: A root cause analysis is a process that is used to identify the underlying cause of a non-conformance.

Q: What is a continuous improvement?
A: Continuous improvement is the ongoing process of identifying and implementing improvements to a company's products and processes.

Q: What is a Kaizen event?
A: A Kaizen event is a focused, short-term project that is used to improve a specific process or product.

Q: What is a value stream map?
A: A value stream map is a visual representation of the steps involved in creating a product, from raw materials to finished goods.

Q: What is a Kanban system?
A: A Kanban system is a lean manufacturing technique that uses visual signals to manage the flow of materials and products through the manufacturing process.

Q: What is a Just-In-Time system?
A: A Just-In-Time system is a lean manufacturing technique that aims to produce products only when they are needed, in the quantities that are needed.

Q: What is a Poka-Yoke?
A: A Poka-Yoke is a mistake-proofing technique that is used to prevent errors from occurring in the manufacturing process.
