A: Lava is molten rock that has erupted from a volcano.

Q: What is magma?
A: Magma is molten rock beneath the Earth's surface.

Q: What is an earthquake?
A: An earthquake is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that causes shaking and ground movement.

Q: What is a fault?
A: A fault is a fracture in the Earth's crust along which movement occurs.

Q: What is a tsunami?
A: A tsunami is a large ocean wave caused by an earthquake, volcanic eruption, or landslide.

Q: What is erosion?
A: Erosion is the process by which rock, soil, and other materials are moved by wind, water, or ice.

Q: What is weathering?
A: Weathering is the breakdown of rock into smaller pieces by physical, chemical, or biological processes.

Q: What is a mineral?
A: A mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with a specific chemical composition and crystal structure.

Q: What is a rock?
A: A rock is a naturally occurring solid composed of one or more minerals.

Q: What is the difference between a rock and a mineral?
A: A mineral is a single substance, while a rock is a combination of minerals or other materials.

Q: What is the rock cycle?
A: The rock cycle is the process by which rocks are formed, broken down, and reformed over time.

Q: What is a sedimentary rock?
A: A sedimentary rock is a rock formed from the accumulation of sediment.

Q: What is a metamorphic rock?
A: A metamorphic rock is a rock that has been changed by heat and pressure.

Q: What is an igneous rock?
A: An igneous rock is a rock formed from the solidification of magma or lava.

Q: What is a fossil?
A: A fossil is the remains or traces of a once-living organism preserved in rock.

Q: What is the geologic time scale?
A: The geologic time scale is a timeline of Earth's history, divided into eons, eras, periods, and epochs.

Q: What is the Precambrian era?
A: The Precambrian era is the longest and oldest era of Earth's history, lasting from the formation of the Earth to the beginning of the Paleozoic era.

Q: What is the Paleozoic era?
A: The Paleozoic era is the era of Earth's history that lasted from 541 to 252 million years ago, characterized by the evolution of fish, amphibians, and reptiles.

Q: What is the Mesozoic era?
A: The Mesozoic era is the era of Earth's history that lasted from 252 to 66 million years ago, characterized by the evolution of dinosaurs and the rise of mammals.

Q: What is the Cenozoic era?
A: The Cenozoic era is the era of Earth's history that began 66 million years ago and continues to the present day, characterized by the evolution of mammals and the rise of humans.

Q: What is plate tectonics?
A: Plate tectonics is the theory that the Earth's lithosphere is divided into a number of large plates that move and interact with each other.

Q: What is a hot spot?
A: A hot spot is a location on the Earth's surface where magma rises from the mantle, forming a volcano.

Q: What is a subduction zone?
A: A subduction zone is a region where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another plate.

Q: What is a mid-ocean ridge?
A: A mid-ocean ridge is an underwater mountain range where new oceanic crust is formed.

Q: What is a rift valley?
A: A rift valley is a long, narrow valley that forms when tectonic plates move apart.

Q: What is a geode?
A: A geode is a hollow rock with a cavity lined with crystals.

Q: What is a stalactite?
A: A stalactite is a mineral deposit that hangs from the ceiling of a cave.

Q: What is a stalagmite?
A: A stalagmite is a mineral deposit that grows up from the floor of a cave.

Q: What is a karst landscape?
A: A karst landscape is a region characterized by sinkholes, caves, and underground drainage systems, formed by the dissolution of limestone or other soluble rocks.

Q: What is a glacier?
A: A glacier is a large mass of ice that moves slowly over land.

Q: What is a moraine?
A: A moraine is a ridge of sediment deposited by a glacier.

Q: What is a fjord?
A: A fjord is a long, narrow inlet of the sea, bordered by steep cliffs, formed by the erosion of a glacier.

Q: What is a delta?
A: A delta is a triangular deposit of sediment at the mouth of a river, formed by the accumulation of sediment carried by the river.
