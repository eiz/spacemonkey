Q: What is the difference between a nebula and a galaxy?
A: A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space, while a galaxy is a large group of stars, gas, and dust held together by gravity.

Q: What is the difference between a red giant and a white dwarf?
A: A red giant is a star that has exhausted its hydrogen fuel and expanded in size, while a white dwarf is a small, dense star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel.

Q: What is the difference between a solar flare and a coronal mass ejection?
A: A solar flare is a sudden, intense burst of radiation from the sun, while a coronal mass ejection is a massive release of plasma and magnetic fields from the sun's corona.

Q: What is the difference between a terrestrial planet and a gas giant?
A: A terrestrial planet is a planet that is small, rocky, and close to the sun, while a gas giant is a planet that is large, gaseous, and far from the sun.

Q: What is the difference between an exoplanet and a planet?
A: An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star outside of our solar system, while a planet is a celestial body that orbits a star.

Q: What is the difference between a solar eclipse and an annular solar eclipse?
A: A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, blocking the sun's light, while an annular solar eclipse is a solar eclipse in which the moon is too far from Earth to completely block the sun's light, creating a ring of light around the moon.
