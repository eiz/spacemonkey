A: Commercial agriculture is a type of agriculture in which farmers grow crops and raise animals to sell for profit.

Q: What is intensive agriculture?
A: Intensive agriculture is a type of agriculture in which farmers use a lot of labor, capital, and other resources to produce high yields of crops or livestock.

Q: What is extensive agriculture?
A: Extensive agriculture is a type of agriculture in which farmers use large amounts of land and minimal labor and capital to produce low yields of crops or livestock.

Q: What is organic agriculture?
A: Organic agriculture is a type of agriculture in which farmers use natural methods to grow crops and raise animals without the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetically modified organisms.

Q: What is sustainable agriculture?
A: Sustainable agriculture is a type of agriculture in which farmers use methods that protect the environment, conserve natural resources, and promote economic viability.

Q: What are the benefits of agriculture?
A: Agriculture provides food, fiber, and other products for human consumption, creates jobs, and contributes to economic development.

Q: What are the challenges of agriculture?
A: Agriculture faces challenges such as climate change, soil degradation, water scarcity, pests and diseases, and food insecurity.

Q: What is crop rotation?
A: Crop rotation is the practice of growing different crops in the same field in different seasons to improve soil fertility and reduce pests and diseases.

Q: What is irrigation?
A: Irrigation is the practice of supplying water to crops through artificial means, such as canals, pipes, or sprinklers.

Q: What is fertilization?
A: Fertilization is the practice of adding nutrients to soil to improve plant growth and yield.

Q: What is pest control?
A: Pest control is the practice of managing pests, such as insects, rodents, and weeds, to reduce their damage to crops.

Q: What is livestock farming?
A: Livestock farming is the practice of raising animals, such as cattle, sheep, pigs, or poultry, for meat, milk, eggs, or other products.

Q: What is aquaculture?
A: Aquaculture is the practice of raising fish, shellfish, or other aquatic organisms in controlled environments, such as ponds, tanks, or cages.

Q: What is agroforestry?
A: Agroforestry is the practice of integrating trees and shrubs with crops or livestock to improve soil fertility, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.

Q: What is precision agriculture?
A: Precision agriculture is the use of technology, such as GPS, sensors, and drones, to optimize crop production and reduce inputs.

Q: What is biotechnology?
A: Biotechnology is the use of living organisms or their products to improve crops, livestock, or other agricultural products.

Q: What is food security?
A: Food security is the state of having access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet dietary needs and preferences.

Q: What is food sovereignty?
A: Food sovereignty is the right of people to control their own food systems, including production, distribution, and consumption.

Q: What is sustainable development?
A: Sustainable development is the development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Q: What is climate change?
A: Climate change is the long-term change in global weather patterns, including temperature, precipitation, and wind, due to human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

Q: What is soil erosion?
A: Soil erosion is the loss of topsoil due to water, wind, or human activities, such as overgrazing, deforestation, or tillage.

Q: What is biodiversity?
A: Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, including species, genes, and ecosystems.

Q: What is genetic diversity?
A: Genetic diversity is the variety of genes within a species or population, which allows for adaptation and evolution.

Q: What is ecosystem services?
A: Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans derive from ecosystems, such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration.

Q: What is sustainable intensification?
A: Sustainable intensification is the practice of increasing agricultural productivity while minimizing negative environmental and social impacts.

Q: What is land use change?
A: Land use change is the conversion of natural or agricultural land to other uses, such as urbanization, mining, or infrastructure development.

Q: What is land degradation?
A: Land degradation is the decline in soil quality, productivity, or biodiversity due to human activities, such as overuse, pollution, or climate change.

Q: What is land tenure?
A: Land tenure is the system of rights and responsibilities that govern the use and ownership of land, including ownership, lease, and customary rights.

Q: What is land grabbing?
A: Land grabbing is the acquisition of large areas of land by foreign or domestic investors, often at the expense of local communities and smallholders.

Q: What is agribusiness?
A: Agribusiness is the business of agriculture, including production, processing, marketing, and distribution of agricultural products.

Q: What is food waste?
A: Food waste is the loss or disposal of edible food, either at the production, processing, distribution, or consumption stages.

Q: What is food loss?
A: Food loss is the reduction in quantity or quality of edible food, either at the production, processing, distribution, or consumption stages.

Q: What is food safety?
A: Food safety is the assurance that food is free from harmful contaminants, such as bacteria, viruses, or chemicals, that can cause illness or injury.

Q: What is food labeling?
A: Food labeling is the practice of providing information about the contents, ingredients, and nutritional value of food products to consumers.

Q: What is fair trade?
A: Fair trade is a system of trade that promotes social and environmental sustainability, as well as fair prices and working conditions for producers in developing countries.

Q: What is organic certification?
A: Organic certification is the process of verifying that agricultural products have been produced according to organic standards, which prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or genetically modified organisms.

Q: What is community-supported agriculture?
A: Community-supported agriculture is a system in which consumers buy shares in a farm and receive a portion of the harvest, thereby supporting local agriculture and reducing food miles.

Q: What is urban agriculture?
A: Urban agriculture is the practice of growing food and raising animals in urban areas, such as rooftops, balconies, or community gardens.

Q: What is regenerative agriculture?
A: Regenerative agriculture is a type of agriculture that aims to restore soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, while producing food and fiber.
