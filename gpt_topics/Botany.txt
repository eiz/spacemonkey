Q: What is a stamen?
A: A stamen is the male reproductive structure of a flower.

Q: What is a pistil?
A: A pistil is the female reproductive structure of a flower.

Q: What is pollination?
A: Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male to the female reproductive structures of a plant.

Q: What is fertilization?
A: Fertilization is the fusion of the male and female gametes to form a zygote.

Q: What is a zygote?
A: A zygote is a fertilized egg that develops into an embryo.

Q: What is germination?
A: Germination is the process by which a seed begins to grow into a new plant.

Q: What is a tropism?
A: A tropism is a plant's response to a stimulus, such as light or gravity.

Q: What is phototropism?
A: Phototropism is a plant's response to light.

Q: What is gravitropism?
A: Gravitropism is a plant's response to gravity.

Q: What is thigmotropism?
A: Thigmotropism is a plant's response to touch.

Q: What is transpiration?
A: Transpiration is the loss of water vapor from a plant's leaves.

Q: What is a xylem?
A: A xylem is a type of plant tissue that transports water and nutrients from the roots to the leaves.

Q: What is a phloem?
A: A phloem is a type of plant tissue that transports sugars and other organic compounds from the leaves to the rest of the plant.

Q: What is a meristem?
A: A meristem is a region of plant tissue that is capable of cell division and growth.

Q: What is a hormone?
A: A hormone is a chemical messenger that regulates plant growth and development.

Q: What is a cytokinin?
A: A cytokinin is a plant hormone that promotes cell division and growth.

Q: What is an auxin?
A: An auxin is a plant hormone that regulates cell elongation and growth.

Q: What is an abscisic acid?
A: An abscisic acid is a plant hormone that regulates plant responses to stress, such as drought.

Q: What is a gibberellin?
A: A gibberellin is a plant hormone that promotes stem and leaf growth.

Q: What is a tropic hormone?
A: A tropic hormone is a hormone that regulates the growth and development of a plant in response to a specific stimulus.
