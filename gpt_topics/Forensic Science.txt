Q: What is the difference between a patent and plastic fingerprint?
A: A patent fingerprint is a visible fingerprint left in a substance such as blood, while a plastic fingerprint is a three-dimensional impression left in a soft material such as clay.

Q: What is the purpose of ballistics analysis?
A: The purpose of ballistics analysis is to determine the type of firearm used in a crime and to match bullets and casings to a specific firearm.

Q: What is the difference between a bullet and a casing?
