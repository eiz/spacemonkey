Q: What is perception?
A: Perception is the process by which we organize and interpret sensory information from our environment.

Q: What is attention?
A: Attention is the process by which we selectively focus on certain aspects of our environment while ignoring others.

Q: What is memory?
A: Memory is the process by which we encode, store, and retrieve information.

Q: What is language?
A: Language is a system of communication that involves the use of symbols, such as words and gestures, to convey meaning.

Q: What is problem-solving?
A: Problem-solving is the process of finding a solution to a problem or challenge.

Q: What is cognitive development?
A: Cognitive development is the process by which children acquire the ability to think, reason, and solve problems.

Q: What is cognitive neuroscience?
A: Cognitive neuroscience is the study of the biological processes that underlie cognitive functions.

Q: What is the difference between bottom-up and top-down processing?
A: Bottom-up processing refers to the processing of sensory information from the environment, while top-down processing refers to the use of prior knowledge and expectations to interpret sensory information.

Q: What is the difference between sensation and perception?
A: Sensation refers to the detection of sensory information from the environment, while perception refers to the interpretation of that sensory information.

Q: What is the difference between short-term memory and long-term memory?
A: Short-term memory is a temporary storage system for information, while long-term memory is a more permanent storage system.

Q: What is the difference between implicit and explicit memory?
A: Implicit memory refers to the unconscious retrieval of information, while explicit memory refers to the conscious retrieval of information.

Q: What is the difference between episodic and semantic memory?
A: Episodic memory refers to memory for specific events or experiences, while semantic memory refers to memory for general knowledge and facts.

Q: What is the difference between a heuristic and an algorithm?
A: A heuristic is a mental shortcut or rule of thumb that helps us solve problems quickly, while an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.

Q: What is the difference between deductive and inductive reasoning?
A: Deductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions from general principles, while inductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions from specific observations.

Q: What is the difference between a prototype and a schema?
A: A prototype is a mental image or best example of a category, while a schema is a mental framework or concept that helps us organize and interpret information.

Q: What is the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset?
A: A fixed mindset is the belief that our abilities are fixed and cannot be changed, while a growth mindset is the belief that our abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication.

Q: What is the difference between a confirmation bias and a hindsight bias?
A: A confirmation bias is the tendency to search for and interpret information in a way that confirms our preexisting beliefs, while a hindsight bias is the tendency to overestimate our ability to have predicted an event after it has occurred.

Q: What is the difference between a self-serving bias and a fundamental attribution error?
A: A self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute our successes to internal factors and our failures to external factors, while a fundamental attribution error is the tendency to overemphasize internal factors and underestimate external factors when explaining the behavior of others.

Q: What is the difference between a working memory and a sensory memory?
A: Working memory is a temporary storage system for information that is actively being processed, while sensory memory is a brief storage system for sensory information.

Q: What is the difference between a phoneme and a morpheme?
A: A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a language, while a morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language.

Q: What is the difference between a mental set and functional fixedness?
A: A mental set is a tendency to approach a problem in a particular way, while functional fixedness is the tendency to see objects as having only one function.

Q: What is the difference between a flashbulb memory and a source memory?
A: A flashbulb memory is a vivid and detailed memory of a significant event, while a source memory is the ability to remember where and how we acquired information.

Q: What is the difference between a proactive interference and a retroactive interference?
A: A proactive interference occurs when previously learned information interferes with the learning of new information, while a retroactive interference occurs when new information interferes with the retrieval of previously learned information.

Q: What is the difference between a primacy effect and a recency effect?
A: A primacy effect is the tendency to remember information that was presented first, while a recency effect is the tendency to remember information that was presented last.

Q: What is the difference between a mental image and a mental model?
A: A mental image is a mental representation of a visual or spatial object, while a mental model is a mental representation of a system or process.

Q: What is the difference between a cognitive map and a mental rotation?
A: A cognitive map is a mental representation of a physical space, while a mental rotation is the ability to mentally rotate an object in space.

Q: What is the difference between a parallel processing and a serial processing?
A: Parallel processing refers to the ability to process multiple pieces of information simultaneously, while serial processing refers to the ability to process only one piece of information at a time.

Q: What is the difference between a subliminal message and a supraliminal message?
A: A subliminal message is a message that is presented below the threshold of conscious awareness, while a supraliminal message is a message that is presented above the threshold of conscious awareness.

Q: What is the difference between a cognitive load and a cognitive overload?
A: A cognitive load is the amount of mental effort required to complete a task, while a cognitive overload occurs when the cognitive load exceeds our capacity to process information.

Q: What is the difference between a mental health disorder and a cognitive disorder?
A: A mental health disorder is a condition that affects our emotional and psychological well-being, while a cognitive disorder is a condition that affects our ability to think, reason, and solve problems.

Q: What is the difference between a cognitive bias and a cognitive distortion?
A: A cognitive bias is a systematic error in thinking that affects our judgments and decisions, while a cognitive distortion is a pattern of negative thinking that affects our emotions and behavior.

Q: What is the difference between a cognitive therapy and a behavioral therapy?
A: Cognitive therapy focuses on changing our thoughts and beliefs, while behavioral therapy focuses on changing our behavior.

Q: What is the difference between a cognitive assessment and a cognitive test?
A: A cognitive assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of our cognitive abilities, while a cognitive test is a specific measure of a particular cognitive ability.

Q: What is the difference between a cognitive enhancer and a cognitive inhibitor?
A: A cognitive enhancer is a substance or activity that improves our cognitive abilities, while a cognitive inhibitor is a substance or activity that impairs our cognitive abilities.

Q: What is the difference between a cognitive reserve and a cognitive decline?
A: A cognitive reserve is the ability of our brain to compensate for age-related changes and damage, while a cognitive decline is the gradual loss of cognitive abilities that occurs with aging.

Q: What is the difference between a cognitive dissonance and a cognitive fusion?
A: Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort that arises when our beliefs and behaviors are inconsistent, while cognitive fusion is the inability to separate our thoughts and feelings from our sense of self.
