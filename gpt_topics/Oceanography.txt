Q: What is a tsunami?
A: A tsunami is a large ocean wave caused by an earthquake, volcanic eruption, or landslide.

Q: What is a coral reef?
A: A coral reef is a structure made up of coral polyps that provides habitat for a variety of marine life.

Q: What is ocean acidification?
A: Ocean acidification is the process by which the pH of the ocean decreases due to increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Q: What is a phytoplankton?
A: Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that float in the ocean and form the base of the marine food chain.

Q: What is a zooplankton?
A: Zooplankton are microscopic animals that float in the ocean and are an important food source for many marine animals.

Q: What is a nekton?
A: Nekton are aquatic animals that are able to swim and move independently of ocean currents.

Q: What is a benthos?
A: Benthos are organisms that live on or in the ocean floor.

Q: What is a hydrothermal vent?
A: A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in the ocean floor where hot water and minerals are released into the ocean.

Q: What is a seamount?
A: A seamount is an underwater mountain that rises from the ocean floor but does not reach the surface.

Q: What is a trench?
A: A trench is a deep, narrow depression in the ocean floor.

Q: What is a continental shelf?
A: A continental shelf is the shallow, submerged edge of a continent that extends out into the ocean.

Q: What is a continental slope?
A: A continental slope is the steep slope that extends from the continental shelf down to the ocean floor.

Q: What is a continental rise?
A: A continental rise is the gently sloping area at the base of the continental slope.

Q: What is a mid-ocean ridge?
A: A mid-ocean ridge is an underwater mountain range that runs through the middle of the ocean.

Q: What is a tsunami warning system?
A: A tsunami warning system is a system of sensors and communication devices that can detect and warn people of an impending tsunami.

Q: What is a marine protected area?
A: A marine protected area is a designated area of the ocean that is protected by law to preserve its natural and cultural resources.

Q: What is oceanography used for?
A: Oceanography is used for a variety of purposes, including understanding climate change, predicting weather patterns, and managing marine resources.

Q: What is the difference between oceanography and marine biology?
A: Oceanography is the study of the physical, chemical, and geological aspects of the ocean, while marine biology is the study of the organisms that live in the ocean.

Q: What is the difference between a sea and an ocean?
A: A sea is a smaller body of saltwater that is partially enclosed by land, while an ocean is a larger body of saltwater that covers most of the Earth's surface.

Q: What is the difference between a tide and a wave?
A: A tide is the rise and fall of the ocean's surface caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun, while a wave is a disturbance on the surface of the ocean caused by wind or other factors.

Q: What is the difference between a hurricane and a typhoon?
A: A hurricane and a typhoon are both tropical cyclones, but a hurricane occurs in the Atlantic Ocean and northeastern Pacific Ocean, while a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.

Q: What is the difference between a fjord and a bay?
A: A fjord is a long, narrow inlet of the sea between steep cliffs, while a bay is a broad inlet of the sea that is partially enclosed by land.

Q: What is the difference between a beach and a shore?
A: A beach is the area of sand or pebbles along the edge of the ocean, while a shore is the land area that borders the ocean.

Q: What is the difference between a current and a tide?
A: A current is a continuous flow of water in a particular direction, while a tide is the rise and fall of the ocean's surface caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun.

Q: What is the difference between a continental shelf and a continental slope?
A: A continental shelf is the shallow, submerged edge of a continent that extends out into the ocean, while a continental slope is the steep slope that extends from the continental shelf down to the ocean floor.
