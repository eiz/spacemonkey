Q: What is a brute-force attack?
A: A brute-force attack is a type of attack where an attacker tries every possible key to decrypt a message.

Q: What is a dictionary attack?
A: A dictionary attack is a type of attack where an attacker tries common words and phrases to decrypt a message.

Q: What is a rainbow table attack?
A: A rainbow table attack is a type of attack where an attacker uses precomputed tables to quickly crack passwords.

Q: What is a side-channel attack?
A: A side-channel attack is a type of attack where an attacker uses information leaked by a cryptographic system to break it.

Q: What is a man-in-the-middle attack?
A: A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of attack where an attacker intercepts communication between two parties.

Q: What is a replay attack?
A: A replay attack is a type of attack where an attacker intercepts and resends a message to achieve a malicious goal.

Q: What is a chosen plaintext attack?
A: A chosen plaintext attack is a type of attack where an attacker can choose the plaintext to be encrypted.

Q: What is a chosen ciphertext attack?
A: A chosen ciphertext attack is a type of attack where an attacker can choose the ciphertext to be decrypted.
